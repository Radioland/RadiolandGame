Radioland is a 3D puzzle platformer set on a chain of islands floating in the sky. Players control Gunther as he navigates through four seasonally themed levels collecting audio logs for retransmission at the ultimate radio tower. We built this game as our final project for Experimental Game Design at RPI and plan to continue development next semester.
